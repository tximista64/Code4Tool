#  Crypto

##  Description

Welcome to this repository dedicated to my homemade tools for **decryption** and **deobfuscation**.  
Whether it's decoding weird strings, understanding obscure algorithms, or just breaking nasty XOR stuff — it's all here.

##  Included Tools

- Custom decryption scripts
- Encoded string analyzers (Base64, XOR, ROT, etc.)
- Handy converters and helpers for CTFs or reverse engineering

##  Purpose

These tools are meant to assist in solving challenges (Root-Me, HackTheBox, TryHackMe…) or in malware analysis.  
They’re simple, modular, and CLI-friendly.

##  Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tximista64/
   cd crypto
```
2. Run the desired tool
3. Customize the script parameters to fit your needs
