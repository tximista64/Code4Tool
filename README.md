#  Crafted Code for Curious Minds

Welcome to **Code4Tool**, a personal lab of handcrafted scripts, tools, and experiments.  
This is a playground for learning, automation, and exploration — where function beats form (most of the time).

##  Repository Structure

The codebase is organized into thematic folders, each targeting a specific technical domain:

- **ASM**  
  Low-level assembly exercises, shellcode experiments, and reverse engineering snippets.

- **Crypto**  
  Tools and scripts for exploring cryptographic concepts, CTF-style challenges, and encryption/decryption utilities.

- **Malware_Analysis**  
  Small scripts and Go tools to help analyze and understand how malware behaves. Dynamic and static approaches.

- **Network**  
  Networking utilities, port scanners, ICMP ping sweepers, and raw socket experiments.

- **Misc**

何?

- **Web**

  Mostly automation scripts

##  Purpose

- **Curiosity-first**: Built to learn, break, rebuild.
- **Minimalist by design**: One file, one idea, one function.
- **Not production-ready**: Sad but unfortunately true...

---

##  Requirements

- Most scripts are written in **Python 3** or **Go 1.22+**
- Run in **Linux**, sometimes with elevated privileges (`sudo`)
- For Go projects, ensure you run with Go modules enabled

---

##  Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tximista64/Code4Tool
cd Code4Tool
# Example: running a quick ip geolocalizer
cd Network
go run kawaii_ip_fetcher.go
```
