# PE Hash Tools

This repository contains two Python scripts designed to extract hashes from Windows PE (Portable Executable) files. These tools are useful for malware analysis, reverse engineering, and identifying similarities between binaries. Tools learnt during HTB academy Intro to malware analasys module

## Scripts

### `imphash.py`

Calculates the **Import Hash (imphash)** of a PE file. This technique is often used in malware classification to detect families based on imported functions.

**Usage:**
```bash
python3 imphash.py <path_to_pe_file>
```

### `sectionhash.py`

Computes the **MD5 and SHA256 hashes for each section** of a PE file. This helps to analyze changes or anomalies section by section, such as signs of packing or tampering.

**Usage:**
```bash
python3 sectionhash.py <path_to_pe_file>
```

##  Dependencies

You need the `pefile` library to run these scripts. Install it using pip:

```bash
pip install pefile
```
