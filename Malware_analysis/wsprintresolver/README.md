# wsprintf_resolver

This Go program reconstructs an obfuscated string commonly found in Windows malware samples. It emulates the behavior of the `wsprintf` function, which builds strings by injecting values into a format string using `%s` placeholders.

I created this tool while working on exercises from the **HTB Academy – Introduction to Malware Analysis** module.

##  How It Works

In many binaries, strings are fragmented and passed as arguments to the `wsprintf` function, with a format string like:
This Go script replicates that logic by:

- Reconstructing the original string using `fmt.Sprintf` (just like in C)
- Passing the format string and its fragments manually
- Printing the final, unobfuscated string

##  Usage

To run the program:

```bash
go run wsprintf_resolver.go
```

You will see an output like:

```bash
Reconstructed string: Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
```
